## Installation

Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the app then run the following command.
` git clone git@github.com:torqie/liri-node-app.git`

This command will create a folder called liri-node-app and the project file will be within that folder. Lets go ahead and change into that directory now
` cd liri-node-app `

Next we need to install the npm dependencies. Run the following command in the terminal.
` npm install `

Great! That is all that is require for installation  for this node app.

## How To Use

Now that you have the node app installed lets go ahead and run the app with the following command
` node liri.js `

From here select one of the following
* concert-this *(Finds concerts by band or artist)*
* spotify-this-song *(Finds information about a song)*
* movie-this *(Finds information about a movie)*
* do-what-it-says *(Reads a text file and does what it says)*

If you select any of the options besides the do-what-it-says option on the next propmp you will be asked for the item you are searching for. Please note that if you dont have an idea of what to search for, we have provided some great defaults.

## Conculsion

I hope that you enjoy my node app as much as I enjoyed making it.
